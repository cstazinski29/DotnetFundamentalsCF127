# dotnet list

Lists the package references or the project-to-project references for a project or solution. This changes based on whether "dotnet list package" or "dotnet list reference" is used

The dotnet list package command provides a convenient option to list all NuGet package references for a specific project or a solution. You first need to build the project in order to have the assets needed for this command to process.

The dotnet list reference command provides a convenient option to list project references for a given project.
